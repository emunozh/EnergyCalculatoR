EnergyCalculatoR
================

The Energy Calculator consist of a single small scrip written in the R language, which provides a function that accepts a range or parameters.
The function has to be loaded as::
  
  source("./Energy_Calculator.r")

That means that the file 'Energy_Calculator.r' has to be on the working path of the main script. 

See the folder *./Examples* for some simple examples on how to use this function.
